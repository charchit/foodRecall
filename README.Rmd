## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install.github("loganjohnson0/foodRecall")

library(foodRecall)
```

## Introduction
To use this package, it is necessary that you register for an API key through the [openFDA website](https://open.fda.gov/apis/authentication/). This is a free API key that only requires your email address. You should receive it immediately upon request. Upon any issues with the API key itself, please contact the openFDA office. Be sure to not share your API key with anyone!

<b>This product uses the openFDA API but is not endorsed or certified by the Food and Drug Administration.</b>

## Save Your API Key
```{r, eval = FALSE}
api_key <- "YOUR API KEY"
```

We have developed a few different functions for you to search for different kinds of data. You can use either <b>recall_location</b> or <b>recall_date</b> to search for data on food recalls. See notation below as an example.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
location <- foodRecall::recall_location(api_key = api_key, 
                                        city = "Ames", 
                                        state = "Iowa")

date <- foodRecall::recall_date(api_key = api_key,
                                recall_initiation_date = )
```

You can also map the resulting data to see the loca

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foodRecall::map_recall(data = df)
```


Check back for additional updates that we plan to add in soon!
